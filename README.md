# Combat Test Tweaks server mod
Combat Test Tweaks is a combat snapshot 8c mod that changes some damage mechanics.
The server's discord: https://discord.gg/Mj2ehN9XVN
### List of everything different from combat snapshot 8c:  
- Swords do the same amount of damage as in 1.16
- Axe, pickaxe, shovel and trident damage is buffed correspondingly to swords
- Sharpness is buffed and ach level gives +1 damage
- Impaling has been nerfed and ach level gives +1.5 damage instead of +2.5
- Enchantment calculations use (15/(15+x)) as the formula instead of (1-x/25) in vanilla, where x means enchantment protection
- Enchantment protection is no longer capped at 20
- Crystals, beds and anchors do 0.5625 times the damage as before (as a balance for nerfed enchantment protection)
- Strength gives +30% damage instead of +20%
